###This is my first rails app :)

This code is pretty non-DRY and I am working on fixing that. 

If you have any suggestions on making this app more RESTy (or any other suggestions) , I'd appreciate a mail. 


You can see a live temporary demo at http://serene-stream-4700.herokuapp.com/

Also, I have hardcoded the book names on the front page in the controller :roflmao:
